    "\n",
    "There exists another method that measures how well each datapoint $x_i$ \"fits\" its assigned cluster *and also* how poorly it fits into other clusters. This is a different way of looking at the same objective. Denote $a_{x_i}$ as the *average* distance from $x_i$ to all other points within its own cluster $k$. The lower the value, the better. On the other hand $b_{x_i}$ is the minimum average distance from $x_i$ to points in a different cluster, minimized over clusters. That is, compute separately for each cluster the average distance from $x_i$ to the points within that cluster, and then take the minimum. The silhouette $s(x_i)$ is defined as\n",

    "The silhouette score is computed on *every datapoint in every cluster*. The silhouette score ranges from -1 (a poor clustering) to +1 (a very dense clustering) with 0 denoting the situation where clusters overlap. Some criteria for the silhouette coefficient is provided in the table below."

    "### Choosing $K$: The Gap Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one last method worth covering for picking $K$, the so-called Gap statistic. The computation for the gap statistic builds on the sum-of-squares established in the Elbow method discussion, and compares it to the sum-of-squares of a \"null distribution,\" that is, a random set of points with no clustering. The estimate for the optimal number of clusters $K$ is the value for which $\\log{SS}$ falls the farthest below that of the reference distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G_k = E_n^*\\{\\log SS_k\\} - \\log SS_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words a good clustering yields a much larger difference between the reference distribution and the clustered data. The reference distribution is a Monte Carlo (randomization) procedure that constructs $B$ random distributions of points within the bounding box (limits) of the original data and then applies K-means to this synthetic distribution of data points.. $E_n^*\\{\\log SS_k\\}$ is just the average $SS_k$ over all $B$ replicates. We then compute the standard deviation $\\sigma_{SS}$ of the values of $SS_k$ computed from the $B$ replicates of the reference distribution and compute\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_k = \\sqrt{1+1/B}\\sigma_{SS}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we choose $K=k$ such that $G_k \\geq G_{k+1} - s_{k+1}$."

    "### Aside: Choosing $K$ when we Have Labels\n",

    "Unsupervised learning expects that we do not have the labels. In some situations, we may wish to cluster data that is labeled. Computing the optimal number of clusters is much easier if we have access to labels. There are several methods available.

    "## Visualizing Clusters using PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we visualize clusters? If we only had two features, we could likely plot the data as is. But we have 100 data points each containing 32 features (dimensions). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will help us reduce the dimensionality of our data from 32 to something lower. For a visualization on the coordinate plane, we will use 2 dimensions. In this exercise, we're going to use it to transform our multi-dimensional dataset into a 2 dimensional dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only one use of PCA for dimension reduction. We can also use PCA when we want to perform regression but we have a set of highly correlated variables. PCA untangles these correlations into a smaller number of features/predictors all of which are orthogonal (not correlated). PCA is also used to reduce a large set of variables into a much smaller one."

    "## Other Clustering Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "k-means is only one of a ton of clustering algorithms. Below is a brief description of several clustering algorithms, and the table provides references to the other clustering algorithms in scikit-learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Affinity Propagation** does not require the number of clusters $K$ to be known in advance! AP uses a \"message passing\" paradigm to cluster points based on their similarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spectral Clustering** uses the eigenvalues of a similarity matrix to reduce the dimensionality of the data before clustering in a lower dimensional space. This is tangentially similar to what we did to visualize k-means clusters using PCA. The number of clusters must be known a priori.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ward's Method** applies to hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering algorithms take a set of data and successively divide the observations into more and more clusters at each layer of the hierarchy. Ward's method is used to determine when two clusters in the hierarchy should be combined into one. It is basically an extension of hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering is *divisive*, that is, all observations are part of the same cluster at first, and at each successive iteration, the clusters are made smaller and smaller. With hierarchical clustering, a hierarchy is constructed, and there is not really the concept of \"number of clusters.\" The number of clusters simply determines how low or how high in the hierarchy we reference and can be determined empirically or by looking at the [dendogram](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agglomerative Clustering** is similar to hierarchical clustering but but is not divisive, it is *agglomerative*. That is, every observation is placed into its own cluster and at each iteration or level or the hierarchy, observations are merged into fewer and fewer clusters until convergence. Similar to hierarchical clustering, the constructed hierarchy contains all possible numbers of clusters and it is up to the analyst to pick the number by reviewing statistics or the dendogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DBSCAN** is based on point density rather than distance. It groups together points with many nearby neighbors. DBSCAN is one of the most cited algorithms in the literature. It does not require knowing the number of clusters a priori, but does require specifying the neighborhood size."
